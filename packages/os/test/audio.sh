# AudioTest (AudioTest.hx) through each back end's real API, without
# speakers. Linux: ALSA's null device, then its file plugin (the samples
# ALSA was given, checked exactly). macOS: the "file:" device (CoreAudio's
# generic output unit, rendered at the clock's pace), then the default
# output when the machine has one (exit 3: none). Windows (AudioTest.exe):
# WASAPI on the default endpoint when the machine has one (exit 3: none);
# on Linux under Wine (WINE, by default /usr/lib/wine/wine64), whose WASAPI
# plays through winealsa to an ALSA default made the file plugin: what
# reaches ALSA is checked (Wine's mixer adds silence before it). The rate
# of the callbacks (--rate) is checked where something paces them: a device,
# CoreAudio's renderer; not ALSA's null and file sinks, which take samples
# as fast as they come, nor Wine's mixer over them.
