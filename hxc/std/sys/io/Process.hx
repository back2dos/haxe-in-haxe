		Construct a `Process` object, which run the given command immediately.

		Command arguments can be passed in two ways: 1. using `args`, 2. appending to `cmd` and leaving `args` as `null`.

		 1. When using `args` to pass command arguments, each argument will be automatically quoted, and shell meta-characters will be escaped if needed.
		`cmd` should be an executable name that can be located in the `PATH` environment variable, or a path to an executable.

		 2. When `args` is not given or is `null`, command arguments can be appended to `cmd`. No automatic quoting/escaping will be performed. `cmd` should be formatted exactly as it would be when typed at the command line.
		It can run executables, as well as shell commands that are not executables (e.g. on Windows: `dir`, `cd`, `echo` etc).

		`detached` allows the created process to be standalone. You cannot communicate with it but you can look at its exit code. Not supported on php.

		`close()` should be called when the `Process` is no longer used.
